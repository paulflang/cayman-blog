title: "Tidy Data"

A data set arranged according to the following principles:

*  In the first columns you have the experimentally controlled variables. In the following columns you have the measured variables.
*  Each row corresponds to a different observation. The cells contain the values of the corresponding variables (note that this is opposed to "wide" data formats, where values are in columns. Consider for instance time-course data. In a tidy data format, you have one column for the variable time. In a wide data format, you have one column for each measured time point).
*  Each type of observational unit forms its own table (called data set normalisation).
