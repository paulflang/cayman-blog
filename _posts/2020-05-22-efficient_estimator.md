title: "Efficient estimator"
---

An estimator is called efficient, if it is the "best possible" estimator of the true parameter. For instance, one can say that the "best possible" estimation is achieved if the bias (i.e. expected difference between estimator and true value, **x<sub>est</sub>** â€“ **x<sub>true</sub>**) points into the direction of the log-likelihood gradient (&nabla;(L(**x<sub>best</sub>**)).
