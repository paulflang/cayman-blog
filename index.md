<img src="./images/portrait.png" align="left"> I am working on mathematical cell cycle models based on multiplexed imaging data. Trying to make the transition from an experimental biologist to a computational systems biologist I regularly come across several fascinating new concepts. To remind my future self of the key ideas of these concepts, I created this glossary. If you are anything like my envisioned future self, you may find this glossary useful, too. However, please take the content of this blog with a grain of salt. Some of the content may be oversimplified or not even correct. If you find mistakes or want to contribute to this glossary, please raise an issue or create a pull request on the [sysbio-glossary GitHub repository](https://github.com/paulflang/sysbio-glossary).
